JWT Refresh Token Rotation

Access Token adn Refresh Token

Access Token = Short Time 
Refresh Token = Long Time

Access Token: Sent as JSON Client stores in memory, Do NOT store in local storage or cookie
Refresh Token: Sent as httpOnly cookie, Not accessible via JavaScript, Must have expiry at some point

Access Token: Sent with every API request, Client uses for API Access until expires, New token issued at Refresh request
Refresh Token: Sent to request new Access Token Verified with endpoint & database, Must be allowed to expire or logout

What if the Refresh Token is comprised?, Malicious access would be granted until the refresh token expires

Refresh Token Rotation: When a new access token is issued, a new refresh token is also issued. This does not eliminate the risk, but it does greatly reduce it!
Refresh Token Reuse Detection: A refresh token can only be used once. If reuse is detected, all refresh tokens are invalidated for the user which will force a new login for authentication.
